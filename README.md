This project applies Machine Learning and Explainable AI (SHAP) to analyze and predict road accident severity using real-world crash data. The study focuses on uncovering key behavioral, environmental, and mobility-related factors influencing accident outcomes.

Objectives
	
 •	Predict accident severity using machine learning
	•	Identify key factors affecting crash severity
	•	Apply Explainable AI (SHAP) for model interpretation
	•	Explore spatial and behavioral crash patterns
	•	Support data-driven traffic safety insights

Dataset

	•	Accident Severity
	•	Date & Time
	•	Latitude & Longitude
	•	District / Location
	•	Road & Weather Conditions
	•	Vehicle & Casualty Information

Methods
	
 •	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	•	Feature Engineering
	•	Random Forest Classification
	•	Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
	•	Explainable AI using SHAP
	•	Crash pattern & severity analysis

Key Insights
	
 •	Identified major factors influencing crash severity
	•	Discovered spatial and environmental crash patterns
	•	Built interpretable ML model for safety analysis
	•	Demonstrated explainable decision-making using SHAP

Tools & Technologies
